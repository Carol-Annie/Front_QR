### What I learned
When developing this project I was able to review and fix the process of creating a card.

```html
<section class="card">
        <div class="imagem">
          <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="">
        </div> <!--card imagem-->

        <div class="descri">
          <h1 class=" title">
            Improve your front-end skills by building projects
          </h1>
          <p class="text">
            Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
          </p>
        </div> <!--descrição-->

      </section>
```
